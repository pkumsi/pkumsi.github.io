  featured: false
  highlights:
    - Conducted 30–60 min semi-structured Zoom interviews with 16 STEM graduate students to study LLM adoption drivers.
    - Built an interview protocol spanning core themes (privacy/accuracy/UI), scenario prompts, and interventions (e.g., opt-out toggle, confidence scores).
    - Performed LLM-assisted initial coding followed by human review; consolidated 44 subcodes into four themes: Performance & Efficiency, Usability & Interface Interaction, Privacy & Data Control, Adoption & Behavioral Patterns.
    - Synthesized implementable product guidance: inline privacy warnings, ephemeral chats, on-device/region hosting options, confidence scores, citations, previews, and lightweight UI toggles.
  details: >
    Explores how users balance privacy, perceived accuracy, and interface usability when choosing between LLMs.
    Findings emphasize accuracy as the primary trust driver, strong preference for clear data controls (opt-in/out, transparency),
    and high value for preview-first UX and quick inline toggles (e.g., show reasoning / disable emojis). Also surfaces adoption
    behaviors like model switching, premium subscriptions, and brand/jurisdiction trust as a fourth emergent factor.
