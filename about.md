    <p>I’m Prerana Kumsi, a full-stack engineer who enjoys bridging design sensibilities with backend pragmatism. I thrive in teams that value clarity, feedback, and iteration.</p>
    <p>My toolkit spans C#/.NET, Java/Spring Boot, React, Python microservices, and modern data stacks. Lately, I’ve focused on retrieval-augmented AI experiences, real-time simulations, and developer experience improvements.</p>
    <p>When I’m not coding, you’ll find me sketching product flows, evaluating AI safety UX patterns, or mentoring peers on system design.</p>

    <h3>Principles</h3>
    <ul class="key-points">
      <li>Design for maintainability: clear boundaries, docs, and tests.</li>
      <li>Build with users: ship small, measure, and adapt quickly.</li>
      <li>Favor readability: code that teammates can trust and extend.</li>
    </ul>
