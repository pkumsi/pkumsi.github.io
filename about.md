    <p>I’m Prerana Kumsi, a full-stack engineer who enjoys bridging design sensibilities with backend pragmatism. Open to roles and collaborations that value innovation, feedback, and user empathy.</p>
    <p>My toolkit spans C#/.NET, Python microservices, React, Java/Spring Boot, and modern data stacks. Lately, I’ve focused on retrieval-augmented AI experiences, real-time simulations, and developer experience improvements.</p>

    <h3>Principles</h3>
    <ul class="key-points">
      <li>Design for maintainability: clear boundaries, docs, and tests.</li>
      <li>Build with users: ship small, measure, and adapt quickly.</li>
      <li>Favor readability: code that teammates can trust and extend.</li>
    </ul>
